# conan-configuration
Stores Conan configuration which is common to all our build images.

The configuration from this repository can be installed using the `conan config install` command, see
https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/consumer/config.html#conan-config-install

```
conan config install http://github.com/ess-dmsc/conan-configuration.git
```

**Beware, installing this configuration will delete any other other remotes you may have configured.**

The important things done by installing this configuration are:
- setting the remotes to the ones we use in our projects
- adding the compiler.libc setting for gcc and clang, so that packages can be built against glibc or musl, this is useful for builds on Alpine Linux where musl is used.

If you update `settings.yml` using one automatically generated by Conan then make sure you retain this change:
```yml
compiler:
  ...
  gcc:
    ...
    libc: [None, glibc, musl]
  clang:
    ..
    libc: [None, glibc, musl]
```
